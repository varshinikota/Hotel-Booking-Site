# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This hotel booking site is crafted to make the process of finding and booking accommodations effortless and enjoyable. With an intuitive interface and clean design, users can easily explore a variety of hotels, view detailed information, and book rooms seamlessly. The platform ensures a hassle-free experience for both first-time and regular users.

Developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the site is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Users can refine their search with filtering options based on location, price, and amenities, helping them find the perfect stay that fits their needs.

The site includes a streamlined booking form, organized hotel listings with images and descriptions, and a performance-focused layout for fast and reliable navigation. The design prioritizes user experience, ensuring smooth interactions and minimal loading times.

Built with scalability in mind, this project can be enhanced with backend integration for real-time updates, secure payment gateways, and advanced features like booking history and user authentication. It reflects modern web development standards with an emphasis on usability and functionality.
